Need to add the markdown readme content here. It'll mostly be about what the local module does and the quirks about Billboards chart site which I think would be useful to share.

#Might need to add this information about appending a new Python related path to look for modules:
>>> import sys 
>>> sys.path.append('/ufs/guido/lib/python')
